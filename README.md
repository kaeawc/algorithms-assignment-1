# Coursera Algorithms I

## Programming Assignment 1




### To Build:

Command Line + JDK

You can run javac -classpath ./algorithms-assignment-1/src/main/java/*.java

IntelliJ + SBT + JDK

    sbt gen-idea

  That should generate the necessary .idea and .idea_modules directories.  Now you just have to open up IntelliJ and set the main class to run.


### To Submit:

I dunno yet.  Probably a gradle or sbt task.
